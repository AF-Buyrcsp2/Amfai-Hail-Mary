## MUTABLE APPEARANCES!

This folder is simply the main repository where we can store our mutable appearance sprites. This is to avoid any confusion on where our sprite accessories are stored. It's recommended if you are making something completely new, have it in it's own .dmi to avoid conflicting with main files we may want to use in the future, though, it doesn't matter much. Do what ever :)
